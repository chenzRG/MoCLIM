MoCLIM, developed by Ziwei Yang, Zheng Chen, Yasuko Matsubara, and Yasushi Sakurai, introduces a novel approach to cancer subtype identification using multi-omics contrastive learning with omics-inference modeling. 

MoCLIM Framework Overview|
:-------------------------:|

An overview of the MoCLIM workflow: (1) MoCLIM takes multi-omics data as input. (2) Omics-specific encoders parallelly learn latent features for each omics source. (3) Multi-omics contrastive learning with a contrastive anchor integrates the learned features. The clustering is implemented on the integrated feature. (4) Comprehensive biomedical evaluations following the feature learning help users understand the results generated by MoCLIM.

## Background

Each specific cancer comprises multiple subtypes. These subtypes refer to groups of patients with specific biochemical mechanisms that require tailored therapeutic strategies.

Different cancer subtypes often share the same morphological traits. This can result in high similarity in histopathological images. However,  the differences can be found across various omics levels.

## Motivation

We position MoCLIM in a biological axiom: genome-wide transcriptomics analysis is the mainstay of omics studies. 

In this schematic diagram, various omics information, including genomics (DNA) and proteomics (protein) data, are interconnected through processes like gene expression and regulation at the mRNA (transcriptomics) level.

## Cancer Subtyping Results & Biomedical Evaluations

Experimental results on six cancer datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves data fit and subtyping performance in fewer high-dimensional cancer instances. 

Moreover, our framework incorporates various medical evaluations as the final component, providing high interpretability in medical analysis.
